            <h3>Suggested Improvements to Avocado Toast Visualisation</h3>
            <p>
                In assignment 2, one of the visualisations selected for critique was the apartment price
                visualisation (avocado toast visualisation) produced by the BBC. The content can be
                referenced below. We will be suggesting several improvements to the visualisation to
                allow it to fulfill its purpose.

                <h3>Explanation</h3>
                <p>
                    In the apartment price visualisation, the question (why/hypothesis) being asked is
                    actually: how many years it would take to afford an apartment deposit in each of the
                    10 cities if one skipped breakfast. That being the case it makes more sense to compare
                    it in terms of the cost of a typical breakfast in each city rather than the price of
                    avocado toast which would depend partially on the cost of avocado in each city which
                    is also influenced by other factors such as proximity of the city to the source of the
                    avocado supply.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since the issue is primarily with the idiom (how) rather than the data (what), an
                    example bar chart has been done to show the number of years needed to afford an apartment
                    deposit in each city. Click on the buttons to compare the deposit and breakfast prices
                    between cities too.
