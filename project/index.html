            <h3>Charlie Hebdo Online Discussion</h3>
            <p>
                In the wake of the Charlie Hebdo killings, there emerged many threads of discussion on Twitter and along
                with them, the spread of rumours related to the event. The visualisations below aim to allow users to
                explore the various tweet trees along with other meta-information pertaining to the event.

            <h3>User Influence</h3>
            <p>
                In any event, a small minority tends to dominate the discussion, the influence of each user is shown
                below, indicating the number of reactions spawned by the user's tweets along with who they interacted
                with most and the number of interactions.

            <h3>Users Activity Trends</h3>
            <p>
                Besides looking at the user influence, we are also interested in user activity in aggregate, thus we
                have a stacked histogram with user tweet, link and thread counts. In general, we observe that most users
                are not very active only having 1 or 2 tweets, in addition from the users are generally only active in
                1 or 2 threads and have few links from their tweets to other tweets. However, there are still some users
                who are more active and garner more attention this is represented by the relatively greater share of
                links versus tweets and threads in the bins with higher counts.

            <h3>Tweet Trees</h3>
            <p>
                Finally, we want to look at the structures of the various tweet trees to see if there are differences
                in the types of conversations happening. Mouseover individual nodes to see tweet details.
