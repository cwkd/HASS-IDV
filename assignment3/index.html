                <h3>A simple interactive chart showing the number of transactions in each town from 2017 to 2022</h3>
                My interest is in the number of resale transactions in each town from the period January 2017 to
                March 2022, and in each town how many of each flat type and flat model are transacted. By clicking on
                the bar, you can navigate to get the charts for transactions by flat type and flat model for the
                selected town.
