                    This visualisation shows what is presumed to be the change in average global temperature with
                    reference to some unknown temperature in the form of a spiral from 1880 to 2021.

                    <ul>
                        <li>Visualisation is cluttered; The orbit path is difficult to distinguish after a few orbits
                            have been made.</li>
                        <li>The circles for +1, 0 and -1 do not make sense, the reference value is not clear.
                            Obviously it is not referring to the start year since the first orbit does not start on the
                            0 circle</li>
                        <li>At the end of the video, when the spiral is rotated, the differences between years is
                            not obvious, the presence of the reference lines on both sides are also distracting.</li>
                        <li>With the vertically stacked orbits, it is possible to see that the temperature in a given
                            year is not constant but the choice of the time of year to show is strange since it does not
                            coincide with either summer or winter months in either the northern or southern hemisphere.

                    This series of visualisations show the price of an apartment deposit in various cities measured in
                    avocado toasts. Presumably it is meant to show how many breakfasts need to be skipped to afford an
                    apartment deposit in that city.

                    <ul>
                        <li>Avocado toasts as a unit of measurement is bad since it is not a common breakfast item
                            across all the compared cities</li>
                        <li>Price of avocado toast in each city is not the same, the comparison becomes meaningless</li>
                        <li>The information across the 10 cities being compared is separated making it difficult to
                            compare visually since the reader would need to reference back and forth</li>
                        <li>Since the intent is to show how long it takes to accumulate enough to afford a deposit in
                            each city, a simple bar chart in a common currency would suffice</li>
